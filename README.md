# Minimal Face Mesh

This project uses TF.js to calculate the facial landmarks.

[DEMO](https://wei-1.github.io/minimum-facemesh/)

There are many Demos out there that are too complex. This repository is the minimum setup that I developed that contains a reasonable amount of component.

This repo uses that latest dependencies from Google at 2021-04-12:
 - tfjs@3.3.0
 - face-landmarks-detection@0.0.3

`We see more than 10% frame rate improvement jumping from TF.js 2.4.0 to TF.js 3.3.0.`

If you want to try this repo by yourself, you can clone the project and use [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) to host the `index.html` file.
